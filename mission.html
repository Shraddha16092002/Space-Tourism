      <img src="spaceX.jpg" alt="">
      <p>SpaceX is already hugely experienced when it comes to launching space-bound flights and the company is also hoping to get on board the space tourism bandwagon.

      <p>To date, Blue Origin has been the main competitor for Virgin Galactic in terms of sub-orbital space travel tourism. However, their offering is based around a more traditional rocket, known as the New Shepard, which takes off and lands vertically, and their objectives are to build towards orbital spaceflight.
